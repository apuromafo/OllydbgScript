      Srcipt for repairing Armadillo's IAT Elimination feature
=======================================================================

This script should help you to rebuild IAT on targets protected
with Armadillo's IAT Eliminator feature. You will need to modify
some parts of script to work on your file. First you need to unpack
your file, and prevent common import redirection and then use this
script after you found OEP. Read my comments below.
