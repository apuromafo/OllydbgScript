TM - WL HWID CISC & RISC Find Bypass & InLine Tutorial

Hello guys,

so today I wanna show you how to.... 

FIND | BYPASS | INLINE

...your TheMida - WinLicense protected HWID | CISC & RISC files in newbie style!

Condition: target with a valid license file
           "can" also work with a faked file in some cases

--------------------------------------------------------
------------------------- CISC -------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

So you maybe already know some other and older HWID bypass tutorials and I will show the way 
again to refresh your mind.I also found a easier method to find the HWID | TRIAL for the 
RISC protection so I think this was always a problem to find it.

Now just follow the videos......


First we start with a CISC exsample to refresh the old find method and this you can do 
manually.

Note: In some special cases it can be that the target used more than one TM WL section!
      Seems to be a rarly used feature.

Push const 
jmp  const  // same jump Addr in a block
Push const
jmp  const
Push const
jmp  const

TM WL section find with: #68????????E9??????FF68????????E9??????FF68????????E9??????FF#
----------------------------
EP Addr             : 00009014
First Jumper Addr   : 00346C43
First Jumper to Addr: 0074BFA1  VA we can use for this = direct value for JMP keep always the same CISC only!
Compare Addr        : not needed
HWID Addr           : 001DB537 | 
HWID DWORD is       : 26A001C9
HWID DWORD must     : 1AE21EEA
TRIAL ADDR          : 001DE3E3 | Just needed if enabled and found in RISC results
TRIAL DWORD is      : 781B9BD5
TRIAL DWORD must    : 46C571D2 
DLL Loca Addr       : 001DC917 | Just needed mostly for faked license files
REP Addr            : 00366479 | Just needed if you have to rebuild the old HWID value!
----------------------------

After using the script you have seen that the file has terminates so in that case we 
have to restore the old HWID DWORD so keep this in your mind if you need to patch it 
back.
So now we have all needed data to create a inline patch with the template which you can 
paste in the MultiASM plugin.Fill all labels which you need.

Enter the 4 section addresses before you paste the template!
<xxxxx000>
<xxxxx100>
<xxxxx400>
<xxxxx600>

Nop this 2 commands if your target is a RISC!
-------------------------
0081646C   CMP BYTE PTR SS:[EBP],0E9                      ; <<<<< Jump check CISC
00816470   JNZ 00816539                                   ; <WinLicen.AUS>


This file used CRC check.You can find it manually or use my CRC script.
If you use the script then set the eip on the old address and set a script BP at line 169 
to bypass the actually EP check!

The CRC script find the old CRC and patched the new CRC value and creates also a 
new file which is ready to use.So you see the file used a successfully inline which 
does check and patch the values which does work also with a fake license file.

Ok this was part one about HWID & CISC to refresh your mind if you forgot it already. :)
So in the next video I show some HWID RISC exsamples so stay tuned!

--------------------------------------------------------
------------------------- RISC -------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

So now I show you how to handle a RISC protected file to find the right DWORDs to patch.

Note: For more detailed informations about RISC you can reas the Oreans RISC machine 
documentation by Deathway.

So you have seen that the CISC method to find the HWID checks its a easy one and which 
is almost a static way.The problem for RISC is that there is not such kind of static 
way [you think].....but I will show you now such kind of static way which you can use 
for your RISC files.So I have test it with diffrent files and I got always the same 
results which I could use to find & patch the right ones.So just follow again.....


----------------------------
EP Addr             : 004F6000
First Jumper Addr   : 00024808
Dynamic Jump command: JMP DWORD PTR DS:[EDI+328]
First Jumper to Addr: not needed
Compare Addr        : not needed
HWID Addr           : 0001DA09
HWID DWORD is       : 0FAAFC29
HWID DWORD must     : 18AA3226
TRIAL ADDR          : -
TRIAL DWORD is      : -
TRIAL DWORD must    : -
DLL Loca Addr       : 0001D63D
REP Addr            : 0027C306
----------------------------

After you found the possible compare commands [mostly 4] you can edit the attached 
Mem Jump Counter script.

Enter in the script: - Found VA of the First Jumper Addr
                     - Found compare VAs
                     - Used compare labels

Now we restart the target and let run the first part of the script.

The script stops if the target runs and you see the HWID nag.Now just note the last 
counter value from the log window and subtract 40 bytes.

Message=COUNTER: 000001A3 sub 40 = 163

So we use this new value to reach the place near at the wanted DWORDs compares later.
Enter the compare value in the script and disable the jmp OVERS command in the script 
save the script and reload it in Olly script window also restart the target and run the 
script again til it stops.


Now resume the second part of the script til your target starts again....

After this open the OllyScript LOG window and copy the whole table into a new txt 
file and save it as log file.

In the next part I will show you how to find the right DWORDs and Addresses.Lets check 
the lof file.....so I have sort the file a little to show you a better overview.

So in this log file I have marked the important blocks for you and you will reconize 
them quickly if you do this with other targets and check the log.So the blocks 
are almost the same.This file used no other DWORD check for the TRIAL so we just need 
to patch the one HWID DWORD.If you have a file which used TRIAL which is already ended 
then you can find the TRIAL DWORD in a higher block as first.....

exsample:

Other target + TRIAL ended
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1        | 0             | 97CF11   1|0
3E6F0904 | 7BE47CE1      | 97CF11   TRIAL
1        | 0             | 97CF11   1|0
521C6AF8 | 1D651E3F      | 97CF11   HWID
----------------------------------------------------------------------

....so it can also differ a bit in some cases but just use the found HWID DWORD 
and search it from the bottom to the top in the log file.


Back to our target
-------------------------------------------
HWID is: 0FAAFC29 | Valid is: 18AA3226


Now lets find the HWID & DLL loca addresses.....

0001DA09  RVA
---------------------
0041DA09  0FAAFC29

029F0000  7C800000  kernel32.7C800000
029F0004  7E360000  USER32.7E360000
029F0008  76350000  COMDLG32.76350000
029F000C  7E670000  SHELL32.7E670000
029F0010  773A0000  comctl32.773A0000
029F0014  00000000

0001D63D  RVA
-------------------
0041D63D  029F0004

So we will log first the found +4 addresses and check them later whether they is right.

Ok now we can again use the other script RISC & CISC HWID TRIAL & DLL Patcher or we do 
it manually this time.So I show you how to check the DWORD manually now.

So if we keep the valid HWID DWORD in the target then it access it also after the code 
section was written with the new data and it checks again for the old DWORD and if its 
not there then it will call a termination.So lets do the same again and this time we 
restore the old DWORD after rhe rep command.

Now we know that we have found the right dll location and that we have to restore the 
old is HWID DWORD and after this the target will start normaly.So lets start to create 
a new InLine file with our data.


Thats it again and we found bypassed and inlined a RISC HWID target.Of course there are 
also other ways to inline the target but I think this way is more better for some 
newbies too.So now you can also start to find bypass & inline + unpacking of the inline 
file of other RISC & CISC target which using a valid license file [faked optional].

I hope you like the tutorial so I tried my best to keep it in a easy mode.

For questions about it you can ask again on my topic.Also keep in your mind that this is 
just a basic way so other targets can also use other check conditions! 

PRESS Pause if it goes to fast......<----- Remember!


Bonus: Video 3

All clear so far for the moment right?Just read my txt files and then start to 
work with it.

So if you come good forward then you can also test your new newbie knowledge on 
other harder files [does differ].I show you.....[not in detail of course] on a 
commercial target.


Ok how you can see the target does not start with the license file so its already 
banned!So now I have already created the log file with all important DWORDS and 
found the 2 which I have to patch to get it run but this log does differ a bit.....
but not so much so just study it and after a while you get a better overview.

So you see its also working for banned licenses etc....


So then have fun with the new stuff which I created and keep clean of course. :)
