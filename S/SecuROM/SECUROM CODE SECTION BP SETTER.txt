/*
 SECUROM Code section bp setter
 By Nukacola
 This script is really simple it set a bp on every call in the format "Call dword ptr [securom]"
 this is the most common way securom use to call itself for resolving the imports. Remeber there are often
 some Calls like "Call securom" this won't bp by this script. You have to watch them yourself.
 I also discovered that the imports solved by different part of code (different resolver). So you Can now 
 watch yourself on how securom handles this calls.
 I guess it's working with Securom from ??? up to 4.84.75
