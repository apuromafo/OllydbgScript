//Anyone has studied the unpacking algo? 
//so as for me I did it the following way: 
//look for 95 8B 07 40 78 bytes 
//------- 
//XCHG EAX,EBP 
//MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EDI] 
//INC EAX 
//------- 
//look down 8 bytes for 
//JMP DWORD PTR DS:[EBX+C] 
//set bp after break step into oep 
//tested on many executables - works fine.
